## Head First Design Patterns in GO

This repo contains Go equivalents of the examples found in "[Head First Design Patterns Samples](https://github.com/bethrobson/Head-First-Design-Patterns/tree/master)".

I converted as much as I could into Go in this book.
And I will continue converting code from Java to GO as much as I could.
